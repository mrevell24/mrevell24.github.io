        <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz package Medjool Date</li>
            <li>1/2 cup peanut butter, thick and creamy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup melted semi-sweet, milk, or dark chocolate</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped peanuts</li>
            <li>flakey sea salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Line a baking tray with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the Medjool dates open down the middle and remove the pit.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press the Medjool date down on the parchment paper, with the
                inside facing down. Repeat with the rest of the dates making
                sure they are tightly packed side by side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread on a thin layer of peanut butter on top. You can pop it
                in the fridge at this step or just continue to the next step.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the chocolate to a microwave-safe bowl and heat in 30-second
                intervals on low power. Mix between each interval until fully
                melted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the chocolate over the peanut butter and use the back of a
                spoon or rubber spatula to spread it into a thin layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle on chopped peanuts and flakey sea salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer to the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes until the chocolate
                is set and firm to touch.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the fridge and transfer to a cutting board.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the bark into equal sections. You can make the squares as
                small or as big as you'd like.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy now or store in an air-tight container in the fridge!
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>TIPS & NOTES</h3>

        <p>
            You can make the date bark as large or as small as you like
            depending how many dates you spread out.

            little of every ingredient as you'd like.
