                    A <b>flower</b>, also known as a <b>bloom</b> or 
                    <b>blossom</b>, is the reproductive structure found in
                    flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae).
                    Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs - 
                    sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower,
                    petals that attract pollinators, and reproductive organs
                    that produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce
                    gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are
                    enclosed within pollen grains produced in the anthers. The
                    female gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced
                    in the carpels.

                    The morphology of a flower, or its form and structure,[6]
                    can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part,
                    consisting of non-reproductive structures such as petals;
                    and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical flower
                    is made up of four kinds of structures attached to the tip
                    of a short stalk or axis, called a receptacle. Each of these
                    parts or floral organs is arranged in a spiral called a
                    whorl.[7] The four main whorls (starting from the base of
                    the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the
                    calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. Together the
                    calyx and corolla make up the non-reproductive part of the
                    flower called the perianth, and in some cases may not be
                    differentiated. If this is the case, then they are described
                    as tepals.[8]
                </p>
                <h3 id="ca">Calyx</h3>
                <p>
                    The sepals, collectively called the calyx, are modified
                    leaves that occur on the outermost whorl of the flower.
                    They are leaf-like, in that they have a broad base, stomata
                    and chlorophyll[9] and may have stipules. Sepals are often
                    waxy and tough, and grow quickly to protect the flower as it
                    develops.[9][10] They may be deciduous, but will more
                    commonly grow on to assist in fruit dispersal. If the calyx
                    is fused together it is called gamosepalous.[9]
                </p>
                <h3 id="co">Corolla</h3>
                <p>
                    The petals, together the corolla, are almost or completely
                    fiberless leaf-like structures that form the innermost whorl
                    of the perianth. They are often delicate and thin, and are
                    usually coloured, shaped, or scented to encourage
                    pollination.[11] Although similar to leaves in shape, they
                    are more comparable to stamens in that they form almost
                    simultaneously with one another, but their subsequent growth
                    is delayed. If the corolla is fused together it is called
                    sympetalous.[12]
                </p>
                <h3 id="an">Androecium</h3>
                <p>
                    The androecium, or stamens, is the whorl of pollen-producing
                    male parts. Stamens consist typically of an anther, made up
                    of four pollen sacs arranged in two thecae, connected to a
                    filament, or stalk. The anther contains microsporocytes
                    which become pollen, the male gametophyte, after undergoing
                    meiosis. Although they exhibit the widest variation among
                    floral organs, the androecium is usually confined just to
                    one whorl and to two whorls only in rare cases. Stamens
                    range in number, size, shape, orientation, and in their
                    point of connection to the flower.[11][12]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, there is only one type of stamen, but there are
                    plant species where the flowers have two types; a "normal"
                    one and one with anthers that produce sterile pollen meant
                    to attract pollinators.[13]
                </p>

                <h1 id="dev">Development</h1>
                <p>
                    A flower develops on a modified shoot or axis from a
                    determinate apical meristem (determinate meaning the axis
                    grows to a set size). It has compressed internodes, bearing
                    structures that in classical plant morphology are
                    interpreted as highly modified leaves.[34] Detailed
                    developmental studies, however, have shown that stamens are
                    often initiated more or less like modified stems (caulomes)
                    that in some cases may even resemble branchlets.[35][16]
                    Taking into account the whole diversity in the development
                    of the androecium of flowering plants, we find a continuum
                    between modified leaves (phyllomes), modified stems
                    (caulomes), and modified branchlets (shoots).[36][37]
                </p>
                <h3 id="tr">Transition</h3>
                <p>
                    The transition to flowering is one of the major phase
                    changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The
                    transition must take place at a time that is favorable for
                    fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring
                    maximal reproductive success. To meet these needs a plant
                    is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental
                    cues such as changes in levels of plant hormones and
                    seasonable temperature and photoperiod changes.[38] Many
                    perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to
                    flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is
                    through the transmission of a complex signal known as
                    florigen, which involves a variety of genes, including
                    Constans, Flowering Locus C, and Flowering Locus T. Florigen
                    is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable
                    conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a
                    number of different physiological and morphological
                    changes.[39]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first step of the transition is the transformation of 
                    the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This 
                    occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular
                    differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue
                    that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the
                    central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the
                    sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion
                    around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances
                    develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once
                    this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed
                    and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of
                    the flower formation event was dependent of some
                    environmental cue.[40]

                <p>
                    The ABC model is a simple model that describes the genes
                    responsible for the development of flowers. Three gene
                    activities interact in a combinatorial manner to determine
                    the developmental identities of the primordia organ within
                    the floral apical meristem. These gene functions are called
                    A, B, and C. A genes are expressed in only outer and lower
                    most section of the apical meristem, which becomes a whorl
                    of sepals. In the second whorl both A and B genes are
                    expressed, leading to the formation of petals. In the third
                    whorl, B and C genes interact to form stamens and in the
                    center of the flower C genes alone give rise to carpels.
                    The model is based upon studies of aberrant flowers and
                    mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana and the snapdragon,
                    Antirrhinum majus. For example, when there is a loss of B
                    gene function, mutant flowers are produced with sepals in
                    the first whorl as usual, but also in the second whorl
                    instead of the normal petal formation. In the third whorl
                    the lack of B function but presence of C function mimics the
                    fourth whorl, leading to the formation of carpels also in
                    the third whorl.[41]
                </p>
                <h3 id="f">Function</h3>
                <p>
                    The principal purpose of a flower is the reproduction[42]
                    of the individual and the species. All flowering plants are
                    heterosporous, that is, every individual plant produces two
                    types of spores. Microspores are produced by meiosis inside
                    anthers and megaspores are produced inside ovules that are
                    within an ovary. Anthers typically consist of four
                    microsporangia and an ovule is an integumented
                    megasporangium. Both types of spores develop into
                    gametophytes inside sporangia. As with all heterosporous
                    plants, the gametophytes also develop inside the spores, 
                    i. e., they are endosporic.
