                <h2>Leatherback Sea Turtle</h2>
                <p id="author">by Shirley Lee</p>

                <p>
                    Leatherback turtles are the most unique sea turtle species!
                    <br> 
                    As the only living member of the Dermochelyidae family, they
                    are quite different from the hard-shell sea turtle species,
                    like green sea turtles. They are also the largest sea 
                    turtles. Leatherbacks reach more than 1.8 m (6 ft) in length
                    and more than 640 kg (1,410 lbs) in weight. During their
                    long migrations, leatherbacks regularly dive to depths
                    greater than 1,000 m (3,281 ft) in search of gelatinous
                    zooplankton, such as jellyfish, to eat. Leatherback turtles
                    are threatened and rapidly declining in many areas of the
                    world.

                <h4>LEATHERBACK TURTLE SCIENTIFIC NAME</h4>
                <p>
                    <i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>
                </p>

                <h4>HOW THREATENED ARE LEATHERBACK TURTLES?</h4>
                <span id="threatened-p">
                    Leatherbacks are listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List
                    of Threatened Species, a status designated in 2013. However,
                    more recent data suggests that leatherbacks may be more 
                    threatened than this status suggests. Each of the 
                    subpopulations of leatherbacks has also been assessed by the
                    IUCN and all are either endangered, critically endangered,
                    or data deficient.

                <h4>THREATS TO LEATHERBACK TURTLES</h4>
                <p>
                    Leatherback sea turtles face numerous threats, most of them
                    related to human activities. These threats include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Fisheries Interactions</b> - the greatest threat to
                        leatherbacks is fishing practices. Fishing nets and
                        lines can accidentally catch leatherbacks entangling and
                        drowning them, an issue called bycatch. Discarded
                        fishing gear, aka “ghost gear” also continues to
                        entangle leatherbacks indefinitely as it floats in the
                        ocean.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Pollution and Pathogens</b> (including plastic 
                        pollution) - plastic pollution affects leatherbacks by 
                        entangling turtles and impeding movement and swimming. 
                        Leatherbacks also eat plastic, mistaking it for 
                        jellyfish, their primary food source, which can cause 
                        choking, intestinal damage, and blockages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Coastal Development</b> - developed beaches restrict 
                        the area that leatherbacks have to lay their nests and 
                        lights from buildings discourage nesting turtles and 
                        disorient hatchlings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Climate Change</b> - changing climate impacts the 
                        leatherbacks' food sources, their migration routes, and 
                        the development of baby turtles. Hotter, dryer sand 
                        negatively impacts the incubation of leatherback nests 
                        and warmer nests produce more female hatchlings than 
                        males - an issue for population demographics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Direct Take</b> - In some places, leatherback eggs 
                        are harvested for consumption, and even adults are 
                        occasionally hunted for their meat.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>LEATHERBACK SEA TURTLE FACTS</h4>
                <div>
                    <ul id="facts">
                        <li>
                            The leatherback is the only remaining member of its
                            taxonomic family (Dermochelyidae).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Leatherbacks rely on a unique suite of adaptations
                            including large body size, changes in activity and
                            metabolic rate, peripheral insulation (i.e. fat),
                            and adjustments in blood flow to maintain stable
                            core body temperatures in varying water temperatures
                            from temperate to tropical latitudes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The largest sea turtle ever reported was an adult
                            male leatherback found in Wales. It was greater than
                            2 meters (6.6 feet) long and 900 kg (1980 lbs) in
                            mass.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The longest recorded leatherback migration was
                            13,000 miles - one way!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Leatherbacks dive much deeper than other turtles,
                            regularly reaching depths beyond 1,000 m (3,281 ft).
                            The leatherback's deepest recorded dives exceed
                            1,250 m (3,900 ft). The leatherback's flexible shell
                            allows them to withstand the pressure of such deep
                            dives.
                        </li>

                <h4>HOW DO LEATHERBACKS REPRODUCE?</h4>
                <div>
                    <ul id="reproduction">
                        <li>
                            Female leatherbacks nest every 2-4 years and lay 4-7
                            clutches of eggs per season. Each clutch contains 50
                            to 90 eggs, which means leatherbacks lay an average 
                            of 350 eggs in a nesting season! 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            An average of 60% of eggs laid in a leatherback nest
                            will hatch.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Leatherback eggs are the size of billiard balls and
                            weigh roughly 80 grams.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A leatherback nest's incubation period is
                            approximately 60 days long.
